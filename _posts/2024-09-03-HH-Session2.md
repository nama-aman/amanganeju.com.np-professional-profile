We now officially wrap up our second session of Holographic Himalaya! A huge shoutout to our mentors and brilliant students for all their hard work over the past six months. Several topics, from traffic physics to black holes, have been explored. Students have prepared their group reports, which can be accessed via this link. Next up, we're diving into the third session. Big thanks to ICTP PWF for supporting us on this journey!
